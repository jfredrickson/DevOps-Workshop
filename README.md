# DevOps Workshop

This repository is a place to share information on DevOps approaches.

The Goal: Figure out a way to automate the entire DevOps process to get code from that repo into dev, test, prod, and go through all the automated testing in between.

* 1.) Have each collaborator stand up their own AWS environments allowing each person to learn by doing.
* 2.) Determine process and tools in AWS to achieve the overarching goal.
